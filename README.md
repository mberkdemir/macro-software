# Macro-Software

### What it does? <br/>
Bisquit Macro is a program that simulates previously defined mouse movements (I will improve the project later. It will have more macros like keyboard and auto record-play).

### How can I use? <br/>
If you want to use program you can download .exe from dist folder. First, you should create macro before activating your macro. Otherwise it will create a macro pattern prints
first character of 'Error'. On 'Create Macro' tab you should add x and y values move to. Also, adding some delay before each coordinates, is not a bad idea. You can activate macro 
using F12 key and select your macro pattern from 'Your Macros' tab. You can increase the power of macro using slider. <br/>
**Important Warning:** Take your own risk when you are using the program for illegal things.

### My program crashed. What should I do? <br/>
If the program crashed take a screenshot of macro's console and send it to me. I will try to fix it.
